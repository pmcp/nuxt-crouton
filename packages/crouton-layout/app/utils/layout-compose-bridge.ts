/**
 * layout-compose-bridge (WS8, #899) — the pure translation between a `LayoutTree`
 * (the single shared model the renderer / breakpoint author edit) and the free
 * `ComposePiece[]` the WS4 compose canvas manipulates.
 *
 * The zoom shell renders the compose canvas at the App level (L2). The canvas thinks
 * in floating cards; every other surface thinks in one tree. This module is the
 * isomorphism between the two so an edit on the canvas (snap two panes together) is
 * the SAME edit the breakpoint author sees when you zoom in — no per-surface copy.
 *
 *  - `treeToPieces(tree)` — explode a layout into draggable cards: a `split` root's
 *    top-level children each become a free piece (tiled along the split axis), so the
 *    user can re-arrange them; a `leaf` / `nested` root is a single piece.
 *  - `piecesToTree(pieces, base)` — recompose the authoritative tree: one piece → its
 *    node IS the root; many pieces → a split of them (axis inferred from their on-canvas
 *    arrangement), sizes apportioned by extent. The base tree's `renderer` /
 *    `breakpoints` carry through (compose only ever restructures `root`).
 *
 * Round-trip stable for the cases that matter: `piecesToTree(treeToPieces(t))` returns
 * a tree that renders the same blocks in the same arrangement.
