/**
 * Event resolver for the standalone sales blocks (Orders, Clients).

 * Resolves an event by slug from the team's events collection and hands the
 * full SalesEvent to the default scoped slot. It calls `useCollectionQuery`
 * (a team-scoped admin endpoint), so it must only be mounted for signed-in
 * team members — the block renderers gate on `useAuth().loggedIn` before
 * mounting it. Top-level await ⇒ the caller wraps it in `<Suspense>` (and the
 * slotted panels — OrdersTab / ClientsPanel — are async-setup too, so the same
 * boundary waits for both).
