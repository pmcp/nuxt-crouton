/**
 * Composable, per-package database seeding.
 *
 * Each package ships a {@link SeedProvider} from its `./seed` entry; an app's
 * seed runner discovers them, orders them by `dependsOn`, and turns their
 * declarative `ctx.upsert(...)` calls into idempotent SQL executed via
 * `wrangler d1` (local or remote). See ./runner.ts for the ordering/collection
 * core and ./sql.ts for the upsert builder.
