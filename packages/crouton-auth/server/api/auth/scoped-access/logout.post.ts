/**
 * Logout Scoped Access Token
 *
 * POST /api/auth/scoped-access/logout
 *
 * Revokes a scoped access token AND clears the httpOnly `scoped-access-token`
 * cookie. Both halves matter for SSR to re-gate:
 *  - The cookie is httpOnly, so client JS can never clear it — only a
 *    Set-Cookie from the server can. Without this the next SSR request would
 *    keep presenting a live cookie and gated pages would still render.
 *  - The token is read from the body OR the cookie, so logout works even when
 *    the client lost its in-memory session but the cookie is still set.
