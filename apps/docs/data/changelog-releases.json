      "body": "> 4.3.0 is the next minor release.\r\n\r\nNuxt 4.3 brings powerful new features for layouts, caching, and developer experience &ndash; plus significant performance improvements under the hood.\r\n\r\n## 📣 Some News\r\n\r\n### Extended v3 Support\r\n\r\nEarly this month, I [opened a discussion](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/33918) to find out how the upgrade had gone from v3 to v4. I was really pleased to hear how well it had gone for most people.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we're committed to making sure no one gets left behind. And so we will **continue to provide security updates and critical bug fix releases** beyond the previously announced end-of-life date of January 31, 2026, meaning Nuxt v3 will meet its end-of-life on July 31, 2026.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> As usual, today also brings a minor release for v3, with many of the same improvements backported from v4.3.\r\n\r\n### Preparing for Nuxt 5\r\n\r\nWe're closer than ever to the releases of Nuxt v5 and Nitro v3. In the coming weeks, the `main` branch of the Nuxt repository will begin receiving initial commits for Nuxt 5. However, it's still **business as usual**.\r\n\r\n- Continue making pull requests to the `main` branch\r\n- We'll backport changes to the `4.x` and `3.x` branches\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out on the [Upgrade Guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/upgrade) &ndash; we'll be adding details about how you can already start migrating your projects to prepare for Nuxt v4 with `future.compatibilityVersion: 5`.\r\n\r\n## 🗂️ Route Rule Layouts\r\n\r\nBut that's enough about the future. We have a lot of good things for you today!\r\n\r\nFirst, you can now set layouts directly in route rules using the new `appLayout` property ([#31092](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/31092)). This provides a centralized, declarative way to manage layouts across your application without scattering `definePageMeta` calls throughout your pages.\r\n\r\n```ts [nuxt.config.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  routeRules: {\r\n    '/admin/**': { appLayout: 'admin' },\r\n    '/dashboard/**': { appLayout: 'dashboard' },\r\n    '/auth/**': { appLayout: 'minimal' }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might be useful for:\r\n\r\n- Admin panels with a shared layout across many routes\r\n- Marketing pages that need a different layout from the app\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Plus, you can pass props to layouts now! See [the `setPageLayout` improvements below](#layout-props-with-setpagelayout).\r\n\r\n## 📦 ISR/SWR Payload Extraction\r\n\r\nPayload extraction now works with ISR (incremental static regeneration), SWR (stale-while-revalidate) and cache `routeRules` ([#33467](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33467)). Previously, only pre-rendered pages could generate `_payload.json` files.\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n- Client-side navigation to ISR/SWR pages can use cached payloads\r\n- CDNs (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare) can cache payload files alongside HTML\r\n- Fewer API calls during navigation &ndash; data can be prefetched and served from the cached payload\r\n\r\n```ts [nuxt.config.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  routeRules: {\r\n    '/products/**': { \r\n      isr: 3600, // Revalidate every hour\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🧹 Dev Mode Payload Extraction\r\n\r\nRelated to the above, payload extraction now also works in development mode ([#30784](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/30784)). This makes it easier to test and debug payload behavior without needing to run a production build.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Payload extraction works in dev mode with `nitro.static` set to `true`, or for individual pages which have `isr`, `swr`, `prerender` or `cache` route rules.\r\n\r\n## 🚫 Disable Modules from Layers\r\n\r\nWhen extending Nuxt layers, you can now disable specific modules that you don't need ([#33883](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33883)). Just pass `false` to the module's options:\r\n\r\n```ts [nuxt.config.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  extends: ['../shared-layer'],\r\n  // disable @nuxt/image from layer\r\n  image: false,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🏷️ Route Groups in Page Meta\r\n\r\n[Route groups](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/pages#route-groups) (folders wrapped in parentheses like `(protected)/`) are now exposed in page meta ([#33460](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33460)). This makes it easy to check which groups a route belongs to in middleware or anywhere you have access to the route.\r\n\r\n```vue [pages/(protected)/dashboard.vue]\r\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\r\n// This page's meta will include: { groups: ['protected'] }\r\nuseRoute().meta.groups\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts [middleware/auth.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {\r\n  if (to.meta.groups?.includes('protected') && !isAuthenticated()) {\r\n    return navigateTo('/login')\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis provides a clean, convention-based approach to route-level authorization without needing to add `definePageMeta` to every protected page.\r\n\r\n## 🎨 Layout Props with `setPageLayout`\r\n\r\nThe `setPageLayout` composable now accepts a second parameter to pass props to your layout ([#33805](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33805)):\r\n\r\n```ts [middleware/admin.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {\r\n  setPageLayout('admin', {\r\n    sidebar: true,\r\n    theme: 'dark'\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```vue [layouts/admin.vue]\r\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\r\ndefineProps<{\r\n  sidebar?: boolean\r\n  theme?: 'light' | 'dark'\r\n}>()\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔧 `#server` Alias\r\n\r\nA new `#server` alias provides clean imports within your server directory ([#33870](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33870)), similar to how `#shared` works:\r\n\r\n```ts [server/api/users/[id]/profile.ts]\r\n// Before: relative path hell\r\nimport { helper } from '../../../../utils/helper'\r\n\r\n// After: clean and predictable\r\nimport { helper } from '#server/utils/helper'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe alias includes import protection &ndash; you can't accidentally import `#server` code from client or shared contexts.\r\n\r\n## 🪟 Draggable Error Overlay\r\n\r\nThe development error overlay introduced in Nuxt 4.2 is now draggable and can be minimized ([#33695](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33695)). You can:\r\n\r\n- Drag it to any corner of the screen (it snaps to edges)\r\n- Minimize it to a small pill button when you want to keep working\r\n- Your position and minimized state persist across page reloads\r\n\r\nThis is a quality-of-life improvement when you're iterating on fixes and don't want the overlay blocking your view.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/nuxt_4-3_error_demo.mp4\r\n\r\n## ⚙️ Async Plugin Constructors\r\n\r\nModule authors can now use async functions when adding build plugins ([#33619](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33619)):\r\n\r\n```ts [modules/my-module.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtModule({\r\n  async setup() {\r\n    // Lazy load only when actually needed\r\n    addVitePlugin(() => import('my-cool-plugin').then(r => r.default()))\r\n    \r\n    // No need to load webpack plugin if using Vite\r\n    addWebpackPlugin(() => import('my-cool-plugin/webpack').then(r => r.default()))\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enables true lazy loading of build plugins, avoiding unnecessary code loading when plugins aren't needed.\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Performance Improvements\r\n\r\nThis release includes several performance optimizations for faster builds:\r\n\r\n- **Hook filters** - Internal plugins now use filters to avoid running hooks unnecessarily ([#33898](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33898))\r\n- **SSR styles optimization** - The `nuxt:ssr-styles` plugin is now significantly faster ([#33862](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33862), [#33865](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33865))\r\n- **Layer alias transform** - Skipped when using Vite (it handles this natively) ([#33864](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33864))\r\n- **Route rules compilation** - Route rules are now compiled into a client chunk using `rou3`, removing the need for `radix3` in the client bundle and eliminating app manifest fetches ([#33920](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33920))\r\n\r\n## 🎨 Inline Styles for Webpack/Rspack\r\n\r\nThe `inlineStyles` feature now works with webpack and rspack builders ([#33966](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33966)), not just Vite. This enables critical CSS inlining for better Core Web Vitals regardless of your bundler choice.\r\n\r\n## ⚠️ Deprecations\r\n\r\n### `statusCode` → `status`, `statusMessage` → `statusText`\r\n\r\nIn preparation for Nitro v3 and H3 v2, we're moving to use Web API naming conventions ([#33912](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33912)). The old properties still work but are deprecated in advance of v5:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: 'Not Found' })\r\n+ throw createError({ status: 404, statusText: 'Not Found' })\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🐛 Bug Fixes\r\n\r\nNotable fixes in this release:\r\n\r\n- Fixed head component deduplication using `key` attribute ([#33958](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33958), [#33963](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33963))\r\n- Fixed async data properties not being reactive in Options API ([#34119](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34119))\r\n- Fixed `useCookie` unsafe number parsing during decode ([#34007](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34007))\r\n- Fixed `NuxtPage` not re-rendering when nested `NuxtLayout` has layouts disabled ([#34078](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34078))\r\n- Fixed client-side pathname decoding for non-ASCII route aliases ([#34043](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34043))\r\n- Fixed suspense remounting when navigating after pending state ([#33991](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33991))\r\n- Fixed clipboard copy in error overlay ([#33873](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33873))\r\n- Enabled `allowArbitraryExtensions` by default in TypeScript config ([#34084](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34084))\r\n- Added `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to server tsconfig for safer typing ([#33985](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33985))\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Enabling `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in the Nitro server TypeScript config improves type safety but may surface new type errors in your server code. This change was necessary because Nuxt's app context performs type checks on server routes ([learn more](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/modules/recipes-advanced#known-limitations)). \r\n>\r\n> While we recommend keeping this enabled for better type safety, you can disable it if needed:\r\n>\r\n> ```ts\r\n> export default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n>   nitro: {\r\n>     typescript: {\r\n>       tsConfig: {\r\n>         compilerOptions: {\r\n>           noUncheckedIndexedAccess: false\r\n>         }\r\n>       }\r\n>     }\r\n>   }\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> Note that disabling this may allow type errors to slip through that could cause runtime issues with indexed access.\r\n\r\n## 📚 Documentation\r\n\r\n- Improved module author guides with clearer structure ([#33803](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33803))\r\n- Added MCP setup instructions for Claude Desktop ([#33914](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33914))\r\n- Added layers directory documentation ([#33967](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33967))\r\n- Added Deno package manager examples ([#34070](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34070))\r\n- Clarified type-checking context limitations for server routes ([#33964](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33964))\r\n\r\n## 🎉 Nuxt 3.21.0\r\n\r\nAlongside v4.3.0, we're releasing **Nuxt v3.21.0** with many of the same improvements backported to the 3.x branch. This release includes:\r\n\r\n- **All the same features**: Route rule layouts, ISR payload extraction, layout props with `setPageLayout`, `#server` alias, draggable error overlay, and more\r\n- **All performance improvements**: SSR styles optimization, hook filters, and route rules compilation\r\n- **Module disabling**: Disable layer modules by setting options to `false`\r\n- **Critical bug fixes**: Async data reactivity in Options API, `useCookie` number parsing, head component deduplication, and more\r\n\r\n## ✅ Upgrading\r\n\r\nOur recommendation for upgrading is to run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpx nuxt upgrade --dedupe\r\n\r\n# or, if you are upgrading to v3.21\r\nnpx nuxt@latest upgrade --dedupe --channel=v3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will deduplicate your lockfile and help ensure you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Check out our [upgrade guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade) if upgrading from an older version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 👉 Changelog\r\n\r\n[compare

I was really pleased to hear how well it had gone for most people.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we're committed to making sure no one gets left behind. And so we will **continue to provide security updates and critical bug fix releases** beyond the previously announced end-of-life date of January 31, 2026, meaning Nuxt v3 will meet its end-of-life on July 31, 2026.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> As usual, today also brings a minor release for v3, with many of the same improvements backported from v4.3.\r\n\r\n### Preparing for Nuxt 5\r\n\r\nWe're closer than ever to the releases of Nuxt v5 and Nitro v3. In the coming weeks, the `main` branch of the Nuxt repository will begin receiving initial commits for Nuxt 5. However, it's still **business as usual**.\r\n\r\n- Continue making pull requests to the `main` branch\r\n- We'll backport changes to the `4.x` and `3.x` branches\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out on the [Upgrade Guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/upgrade) &ndash; we'll be adding details about how you can already start migrating your projects to prepare for Nuxt v4 with `future.compatibilityVersion: 5`.\r\n\r\n## 🗂️ Route Rule Layouts\r\n\r\nBut that's enough about the future. We have a lot of good things for you today!\r\n\r\nFirst, you can now set layouts directly in route rules using the new `appLayout` property ([#31092](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/31092)). This provides a centralized, declarative way to manage layouts across your application without scattering `definePageMeta` calls throughout your pages.\r\n\r\n```ts [nuxt.config.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  routeRules: {\r\n    '/admin/**': { appLayout: 'admin' },\r\n    '/dashboard/**': { appLayout: 'dashboard' },\r\n    '/auth/**': { appLayout: 'minimal' }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might be useful for:\r\n\r\n- Admin panels with a shared layout across many routes\r\n- Marketing pages that need a different layout from the app\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Plus, you can pass props to layouts now! See [the `setPageLayout` improvements below](#layout-props-with-setpagelayout).\r\n\r\n## 📦 ISR/SWR Payload Extraction\r\n\r\nPayload extraction now works with ISR (incremental static regeneration), SWR (stale-while-revalidate) and cache `routeRules` ([#33467](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33467)). Previously, only pre-rendered pages could generate `_payload.json` files.\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n- Client-side navigation to ISR/SWR pages can use cached payloads\r\n- CDNs (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare) can cache payload files alongside HTML\r\n- Fewer API calls during navigation &ndash; data can be prefetched and served from the cached payload\r\n\r\n```ts [nuxt.config.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  routeRules: {\r\n    '/products/**': { \r\n      isr: 3600, // Revalidate every hour\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🧹 Dev Mode Payload Extraction\r\n\r\nRelated to the above, payload extraction now also works in development mode ([#30784](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/30784)). This makes it easier to test and debug payload behavior without needing to run a production build.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Payload extraction works in dev mode with `nitro.static` set to `true`, or for individual pages which have `isr`, `swr`, `prerender` or `cache` route rules.\r\n\r\n## 🚫 Disable Modules from Layers\r\n\r\nWhen extending Nuxt layers, you can now disable specific modules that you don't need ([#33883](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33883)). Just pass `false` to the module's options:\r\n\r\n```ts [nuxt.config.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  extends: ['../shared-layer'],\r\n  // disable @nuxt/image from layer\r\n  image: false,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🏷️ Route Groups in Page Meta\r\n\r\n[Route groups](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/pages#route-groups) (folders wrapped in parentheses like `(protected)/`) are now exposed in page meta ([#33460](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33460)). This makes it easy to check which groups a route belongs to in middleware or anywhere you have access to the route.\r\n\r\n```vue [pages/(protected)/dashboard.vue]\r\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\r\n// This page's meta will include: { groups: ['protected'] }\r\nuseRoute().meta.groups\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts [middleware/auth.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {\r\n  if (to.meta.groups?.includes('protected') && !isAuthenticated()) {\r\n    return navigateTo('/login')\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis provides a clean, convention-based approach to route-level authorization without needing to add `definePageMeta` to every protected page.\r\n\r\n## 🎨 Layout Props with `setPageLayout`\r\n\r\nThe `setPageLayout` composable now accepts a second parameter to pass props to your layout ([#33805](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33805)):\r\n\r\n```ts [middleware/admin.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {\r\n  setPageLayout('admin', {\r\n    sidebar: true,\r\n    theme: 'dark'\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```vue [layouts/admin.vue]\r\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\r\ndefineProps<{\r\n  sidebar?: boolean\r\n  theme?: 'light' | 'dark'\r\n}>()\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🔧 `#server` Alias\r\n\r\nA new `#server` alias provides clean imports within your server directory ([#33870](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33870)), similar to how `#shared` works:\r\n\r\n```ts [server/api/users/[id]/profile.ts]\r\n// Before: relative path hell\r\nimport { helper } from '../../../../utils/helper'\r\n\r\n// After: clean and predictable\r\nimport { helper } from '#server/utils/helper'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe alias includes import protection &ndash; you can't accidentally import `#server` code from client or shared contexts.\r\n\r\n## 🪟 Draggable Error Overlay\r\n\r\nThe development error overlay introduced in Nuxt 4.2 is now draggable and can be minimized ([#33695](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33695)). You can:\r\n\r\n- Drag it to any corner of the screen (it snaps to edges)\r\n- Minimize it to a small pill button when you want to keep working\r\n- Your position and minimized state persist across page reloads\r\n\r\nThis is a quality-of-life improvement when you're iterating on fixes and don't want the overlay blocking your view.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/nuxt_4-3_error_demo.mp4\r\n\r\n## ⚙️ Async Plugin Constructors\r\n\r\nModule authors can now use async functions when adding build plugins ([#33619](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33619)):\r\n\r\n```ts [modules/my-module.ts]\r\nexport default defineNuxtModule({\r\n  async setup() {\r\n    // Lazy load only when actually needed\r\n    addVitePlugin(() => import('my-cool-plugin').then(r => r.default()))\r\n    \r\n    // No need to load webpack plugin if using Vite\r\n    addWebpackPlugin(() => import('my-cool-plugin/webpack').then(r => r.default()))\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enables true lazy loading of build plugins, avoiding unnecessary code loading when plugins aren't needed.\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Performance Improvements\r\n\r\nThis release includes several performance optimizations for faster builds:\r\n\r\n- **Hook filters** - Internal plugins now use filters to avoid running hooks unnecessarily ([#33898](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33898))\r\n- **SSR styles optimization** - The `nuxt:ssr-styles` plugin is now significantly faster ([#33862](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33862), [#33865](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33865))\r\n- **Layer alias transform** - Skipped when using Vite (it handles this natively) ([#33864](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33864))\r\n- **Route rules compilation** - Route rules are now compiled into a client chunk using `rou3`, removing the need for `radix3` in the client bundle and eliminating app manifest fetches ([#33920](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33920))\r\n\r\n## 🎨 Inline Styles for Webpack/Rspack\r\n\r\nThe `inlineStyles` feature now works with webpack and rspack builders ([#33966](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33966)), not just Vite. This enables critical CSS inlining for better Core Web Vitals regardless of your bundler choice.\r\n\r\n## ⚠️ Deprecations\r\n\r\n### `statusCode` → `status`, `statusMessage` → `statusText`\r\n\r\nIn preparation for Nitro v3 and H3 v2, we're moving to use Web API naming conventions ([#33912](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33912)). The old properties still work but are deprecated in advance of v5:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: 'Not Found' })\r\n+ throw createError({ status: 404, statusText: 'Not Found' })\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🐛 Bug Fixes\r\n\r\nNotable fixes in this release:\r\n\r\n- Fixed head component deduplication using `key` attribute ([#33958](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33958), [#33963](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33963))\r\n- Fixed async data properties not being reactive in Options API ([#34119](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34119))\r\n- Fixed `useCookie` unsafe number parsing during decode ([#34007](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34007))\r\n- Fixed `NuxtPage` not re-rendering when nested `NuxtLayout` has layouts disabled ([#34078](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34078))\r\n- Fixed client-side pathname decoding for non-ASCII route aliases ([#34043](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34043))\r\n- Fixed suspense remounting when navigating after pending state ([#33991](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33991))\r\n- Fixed clipboard copy in error overlay ([#33873](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33873))\r\n- Enabled `allowArbitraryExtensions` by default in TypeScript config ([#34084](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34084))\r\n- Added `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to server tsconfig for safer typing ([#33985](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33985))\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Enabling `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in the Nitro server TypeScript config improves type safety but may surface new type errors in your server code. This change was necessary because Nuxt's app context performs type checks on server routes ([learn more](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/modules/recipes-advanced#known-limitations)). \r\n>\r\n> While we recommend keeping this enabled for better type safety, you can disable it if needed:\r\n>\r\n> ```ts\r\n> export default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n>   nitro: {\r\n>     typescript: {\r\n>       tsConfig: {\r\n>         compilerOptions: {\r\n>           noUncheckedIndexedAccess: false\r\n>         }\r\n>       }\r\n>     }\r\n>   }\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> Note that disabling this may allow type errors to slip through that could cause runtime issues with indexed access.\r\n\r\n## 📚 Documentation\r\n\r\n- Improved module author guides with clearer structure ([#33803](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33803))\r\n- Added MCP setup instructions for Claude Desktop ([#33914](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33914))\r\n- Added layers directory documentation ([#33967](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33967))\r\n- Added Deno package manager examples ([#34070](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34070))\r\n- Clarified type-checking context limitations for server routes ([#33964](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33964))\r\n\r\n## 🎉 Nuxt 3.21.0\r\n\r\nAlongside v4.3.0, we're releasing **Nuxt v3.21.0** with many of the same improvements backported to the 3.x branch. This release includes:\r\n\r\n- **All the same features**: Route rule layouts, ISR payload extraction, layout props with `setPageLayout`, `#server` alias, draggable error overlay, and more\r\n- **All performance improvements**: SSR styles optimization, hook filters, and route rules compilation\r\n- **Module disabling**: Disable layer modules by setting options to `false`\r\n- **Critical bug fixes**: Async data reactivity in Options API, `useCookie` number parsing, head component deduplication, and more\r\n\r\n## ✅ Upgrading\r\n\r\nOur recommendation for upgrading is to run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpx nuxt@latest upgrade --dedupe --channel=v3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will deduplicate your lockfile and help ensure you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Check out our [upgrade guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade) if upgrading from an older version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 👉

      "body": "🔋 This release contains [many improvements](https://github.com/nitrojs/nitro/compare/c1d0901cb151525fe89178ba1b5c2a6de6c3b5af...main) since the [alpha.1](https://github.com/nitrojs/nitro/releases/tag/v3.0.1-alpha.1) release.  \r\n\r\n⏳ We took extra time to ensure everything works well by testing against real-world projects using Nitro v3.\r\n\r\n🎯 We are closer to **Beta** now. Expect more regular v3 releases!\r\n\r\n💬 **Join the [Nitro Discord](https://discord.nitro.build) for discussions and to report any issues you encounter with Nitro v3 alpha.**\r\n\r\n## 🌟 What’s new?\r\n\r\n### 🔥 Rolldown-optimized\r\n\r\nWe optimized all internal and built-in Nitro plugins and configurations for first-class Rolldown support. We recommend that everyone migrate to rolldown and `vite@beta`, powered by rolldown.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Upgrade to the latest Nitro v3 with `vite@beta` (rolldown) and enjoy a **seriously mind-blowing performance boost** 🚀\r\n\r\n### 📦 Dependencies are bundled by default\r\n\r\nNitro always generates an optimized and portable build output, containing all of your production dependencies.\r\n\r\nPreviously, all dependencies were copied (traced) into `.output/server/node_modules` unless configured to be inlined (bundled).\r\n\r\nAfter adopting Rolldown, we found that bundling produces a more optimized and predictable output, but also is WAY faster to bundle dependencies with Rolldown rather than tracing (copying) them. Nitro now bundles dependencies by default using Rolldown (or Rollup).  \r\n\r\nNitro has a built-in list of known dependencies with native Node.js bindings or incompatibilities. Only those dependencies are traced.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> If you need to trace additional dependencies that are incompatible with bundling, use the new `traceDeps: []` config option to mark them as traced.\r\n\r\n### ⚛ React Server Components Support\r\n\r\nThanks to @hi-ogawa, you can now use Nitro with `@vitejs/plugin-rsc`.\r\n\r\n> [!TIP]\r\n> Cheeckout [`vite-rsc` example](https://github.com/nitrojs/nitro/tree/main/examples/vite-rsc) for demo.\r\n\r\n## ⬆️ Migration\r\n\r\nWe have added an experimental feature to support path aliases from `tsconfig.json`. The experimental flag is now disabled by default. \r\n\r\nWith `vite@beta`, you can use rolldown's native support:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; \r\nimport { nitro } from \"nitro/vite\";\r\n\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  plugins: [ nitro({ serverDir: \"./server\" })],\r\n  resolve: { tsconfigPaths: true } // requires vite@beta\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n##

We did rework our query builder chain and it supports both EffectLike and PromiseLike flows, we will gather feedback from the community and ship other dialects support  \r\n- We did also rework(simplified) `PgColumn` type chain, it's now mostly decoupled from other dialects, it now has better type performance and simpler declaration chain. We did remove PgArray column recursive wrapper, every `PgColumn` now has dimensions property both in runtime and type chain for external usage like validation packages\r\n- We have 1 breaking API change too, postgres `.array()` is now not chainable, if you want to have multidimensional array it's now `.array('[][]')`,`.array('[][][]')`, etc.  \r\n- Fixed lack of query result recalculation on pg dynamic update with joins  \r\n- Switched `MySQL2` default client from `CallbackPool` to `Pool`  \r\n\r\n- We've migrated away from `esbuild-register` to `tsx` loader, it will now allow to use drizzle-kit seamlessly with both ESM and CJS modules  \r\n- We've also added native Bun and Deno launch support, which will not trigger tsx loader and utilise native bun and deno imports capabilities and faster startup times",

It is 100% opt-in, and supports a subset of existing Vue APIs with mostly identical behavior.\r\n\r\nVapor Mode has demonstrated the same level of performance with Solid and Svelte 5 in [3rd party benchmarks](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark).\r\n\r\n#### General Stability Notes\r\n\r\nVapor Mode is feature-complete in Vue 3.6 beta, but is still considered unstable. For now, we recommend using it for the following cases:\r\n\r\n- Partial usage in existing apps, e.g. implementing a perf-sensitive sub page in Vapor Mode.\r\n- Build small new apps entirely in Vapor Mode.\r\n\r\n#### Opting in to Vapor Mode\r\n\r\nVapor Mode only works for Single File Components using `<script setup>`. To opt-in, add the `vapor` attribute to `<script setup>`:\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<script setup vapor>\r\n// ...\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nVapor Mode components are usable in two scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. Inside a Vapor app instance create via `createVaporApp`. Apps created this way avoids pulling in the Virtual DOM runtime code and allows bundle baseline size to be drastically reduced.\r\n\r\n2. To use Vapor components in a VDOM app instance created via `createApp`, the `vaporInteropPlugin` must be installed:\r\n\r\n   ```js\r\n   import { createApp, vaporInteropPlugin } from 'vue'\r\n   import App from './App.vue'\r\n\r\n   createApp(App)\r\n     .use(vaporInteropPlugin) // enable vapor interop\r\n     .mount('#app')\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   A Vapor app instance can also install `vaporInteropPlugin` to allow vdom components to be used inside, but it will pull in the vdom runtime and offset the benefits of a smaller bundle.\r\n\r\n#### VDOM Interop Limitations\r\n\r\nWhen the interop plugin is installed, Vapor and non-Vapor components can be nested inside each other. This currently covers standard props, events, and slots usage, but does not yet account for all possible edge cases. For example, there will most likely still be rough edges when using a VDOM-based component library in Vapor Mode.\r\n\r\nA know issue is that vapor slots cannot be rendered with `slots.default()` inside a VDOM component. `renderSlot` must be used instead. [[Example](https://play.vuejs.org/#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)]\r\n\r\nThis is expected to improve over time, but in general, we recommend having distinct \"regions\" in your app where it's one mode or another, and avoid mixed nesting as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we may provide support tooling to enforce Vapor usage boundaries in codebases.\r\n\r\n#### Feature Compatibility\r\n\r\nBy design, Vapor Mode supports a **subset** of existing Vue features. For the supported subset, we aim to deliver the exact same behavior per API specifications. At the same time, this means there are some features that are explicitly not supported in Vapor Mode:\r\n\r\n- Options API\r\n- `app.config.globalProperties`\r\n- `getCurrentInstance()` returns `null` in Vapor components\r\n- `@vue:xxx` per-element lifecycle events\r\n\r\nCustom directives in Vapor also have a different interface:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype VaporDirective = (\r\n  node: Element | VaporComponentInstance,\r\n  value?: () => any,\r\n  argument?: string,\r\n  modifiers?: DirectiveModifiers,\r\n) => (() => void) | void\r\n```\r\n\r\n`value` is a reactive getter that returns the binding value. The user can set up reactive effects using `watchEffect` (auto released when component unmounts), and can optionally return a cleanup function. Example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst MyDirective = (el, source) => {\r\n  watchEffect(() => {\r\n    el.textContent = source()\r\n  })\r\n  return () => console.log('cleanup')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Behavior Consistency\r\n\r\nVapor Mode attempts to match VDOM Mode behavior as much as possible, but there could still be minor behavior inconsistencies in edge cases due to how fundamentally different the two rendering modes are. In general, we do not consider a minor inconsistency to be breaking change unless the behavior has previously been documented.\r\n\r\nFor stable releases, please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\r\nFor pre-releases, please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/minor/CHANGELOG.md) of the `minor` branch.",

If anything goes wrong, you can either downgrade to version `1.0.0-beta.1` or `0.44.7`, and please report any issues on GitHub or our Discord!\r\n\r\n> Don't forget to check `1.0.0-beta.1` release notes as well: https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/blob/beta/changelogs/drizzle-orm/1.0.0-beta.1.md\r\n\r\n> Check the migration guide for RQBv1 to RQBv2 migration steps: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/relations-v1-v2\r\n\r\n> Check new RQBv2 schema docs: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/relations-v2 \r\n\r\n> Check new RQBv2 query docs: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb-v2\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n## MSSQL dialect \r\n\r\nDrizzle now supports MSSQL in `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit` and `drizzle-seed` packages. It support most of the columns, query builder capabilities, migration strategies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe only feature that is not yet supported is `RQBv2`\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Make sure to install the 'mssql' package \r\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-mssql';\r\n\r\nconst db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL);\r\n \r\nconst result = await db.execute('select 1');\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n// Make sure to install the 'pg' package \r\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-mssql';\r\n\r\n// You can specify any property from the mssql connection options\r\nconst db = drizzle({ \r\n  connection: { \r\n    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\r\n    ssl: true\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n \r\nconst result = await db.execute('select 1');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## CockroachDB dialect\r\n\r\nDrizzle now supports MSSQL in `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit` and `drizzle-seed` packages. It support most of the columns, query builder capabilities, migration strategies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe only feature that is not yet supported is `RQBv2`\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Make sure to install the 'pg' package \r\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/cockroach';\r\n\r\nconst db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL);\r\n \r\nconst result = await db.execute('select 1');\r\n```\r\n```ts\r\n// Make sure to install the 'pg' package \r\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/cockroach';\r\n\r\n// You can specify any property from the node-postgres connection options\r\nconst db = drizzle({ \r\n  connection: { \r\n    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,\r\n    ssl: true\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n \r\nconst result = await db.execute('select 1');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Relational Query Parts\r\n\r\nIn a case you need to separate relations config into several parts you can use `defineRelationsPart` helpers\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { defineRelations, defineRelationsPart } from 'drizzle-orm';\r\nimport * as schema from \"./schema\";\r\nexport const relations = defineRelations(schema, (r) => ({\r\n  users: {\r\n    invitee: r.one.users({\r\n      from: r.users.invitedBy,\r\n      to: r.users.id,\r\n    }),\r\n    posts: r.many.posts(),\r\n  }\r\n}));\r\nexport const part = defineRelationsPart(schema, (r) => ({\r\n  posts: {\r\n    author: r.one.users({\r\n      from: r.posts.authorId,\r\n      to: r.users.id,\r\n    }),\r\n  }\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then you can provide it to the db instance\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst db = drizzle(process.env.DB_URL, { relations: { ...relations, ...part } })\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Folders v3 migrations\r\n\r\n> Linked discussion: https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/2832\r\n\r\nWe've updated the migrations folder structure by:\r\n- removing journal.json\r\n- grouping SQL files and snapshots into separate migration folders\r\n- removing the `drizzle-kit drop` command\r\n\r\nThese changes eliminate potential Git conflicts with the journal file and simplify the process of dropping or fixing conflicted migrations\r\n\r\nIn upcoming beta releases, we'll introduce commutativity checks to help guide you through team migration conflicts, detect possible collisions, and suggest ways to resolve them\r\n> Commutativity discussion: https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/discussions/5005\r\n\r\nTo migrate previous folders to a new format you would need to run\r\n```\r\ndrizzle-kit up\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Full `drizzle-kit` rewrite\r\n\r\nArchitecture rewrite to close major kit and migration issues. We’ve completed a set of valuable and necessary updates to help us iterate faster, improve test coverage, and enhance overall stability.\r\n\r\nSummary of work completed:\r\n- Migrated from database snapshots to database DDL snapshots\r\n- Reworked the entire architecture for detecting and applying diffs\r\n- Added significant improvements for defaults, expressions, and types detection\r\n- Reduced schema introspection time from 10 seconds to under 1 second by minimizing database calls and query complexity\r\n- Added query hints and explain support for push\r\n- Expanded test coverage - each test case now runs up to 6 different scenarios (e.g., push+push, pull+generate, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Added `drizzle-kit pull --init`\r\n\r\nThis flag will create a drizzle migration table in the database and will mark first pulled migration as applied, so you can contrinue iterating from there\r\n\r\n## `schemaFilter` behavior update\r\n\r\n`drizzle-kit` will start managing all the schemas defined in your code. If you want to filter them, you can use `schemaFilter` \r\nPreviously, only the public schema was managed unless you explicitly added more schemas to `schemaFilter`.\r\n\r\nIt now also supports glob patterns, allowing you to filter schemas in any way you like\r\n\r\n## `.enableRLS()` deprecation\r\n\r\nPreviously to mark PostgreSQL table with RLS enabled you would need to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// OLD syntax\r\npgTable('name', {}).enableRLS()\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWe moved this option to a different place\r\n\r\n```ts\r\npgTable.withRLS('users', {});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alias directly on columns\r\n\r\nYou can now add `as` alias to the column in a simple way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst query = db\r\n\t.select({ age: users.age.as('ageOfUser'), id: users.id.as('userId') })\r\n\t.from(users)\r\n\t.orderBy(asc(users.id.as('userId')));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## MySQL new column types\r\n\r\nWe've added a few more MySQL column types:\r\n\r\n- blob: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/column-types/mysql#blob\r\n- tinyblob: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/column-types/mysql#tinyblob\r\n- mediumblob: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/column-types/mysql#mediumblob\r\n- longblob: https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/column-types/mysql#longblob\r\n\r\n## More Updates and Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed pg-native Pool detection in node-postgres transactions  \r\n- Allowed subqueries in select fields  \r\n- Updated typo algorythm => algorithm  \r\n- Fixed `$onUpdate` not handling `SQL` values (fixes [#2388](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/2388), tests implemented by [L-Mario564](https://github.com/L-Mario564) in [#2911](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2911))\r\n- Fixed `pg` mappers not handling `Date` instances in `bun-sql:postgresql` driver responses for `date`, `timestamp` types (fixes [#4493](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/4493))  \r\n\r\n## Bugs fixed\r\n\r\n> This list is not full, we just had a time to get through some of the issues.

This affects `InputMenu`, `InputNumber`, `InputTags`, `Select`, and `SelectMenu`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\r\nconst inputMenu = useTemplateRef('inputMenu')\r\n\r\n- inputMenu.value.inputRef.$el // Component instance\r\n+ inputMenu.value.inputRef // HTML element directly\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **module:** properly export composables from module ([cb25902](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/cb25902))\r\n\r\nThere was an issue with how composables were exported, you no longer need the `.js` extension:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\r\n- import { useToast } from '@nuxt/ui/composables/useToast.js'\r\n+ import { useToast } from '@nuxt/ui/composables/useToast'\r\n// or\r\n+ import { useToast } from '@nuxt/ui/composables'\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **vite:** write theme templates ([#5355](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5355)) ([411ebcc](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/411ebcc))\r\n\r\nThe Vite plugin now properly generates theme files as real files instead of incorrectly shipping them inside `.nuxt/` on NPM. This ensures the `#build/ui.css` import and custom theme configuration work correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen using the Vite plugin, update your `tsconfig.node.json` alias:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"#build/ui\": [\r\n-       \"./node_modules/@nuxt/ui/.nuxt/ui\"\r\n+       \"./node_modules/.nuxt-ui/ui\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## :rocket: Features\r\n\r\n* **components:** add `data-slot` attributes ([#5447](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5447))

Fixes\r\n\r\n* **AuthForm:** ensure header is shown with `leading` slot ([#5405](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5405)) ([b61127a](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/b61127a))\r\n* **AuthForm:** use

([a8f2156](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/a8f2156)), closes [#5300](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5300)\r\n* **CheckboxGroup/RadioGroup/Switch:** consistent disabled styles ([ddd8faf](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/ddd8faf)), closes [#5391](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5391)\r\n* **ColorModeButton:** use css to display color mode icon ([#5394](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5394)) ([1d1c638](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/1d1c638))\r\n* **CommandPalette/ContentSearch:** improve performances and filtering logic

([fce2df4](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/fce2df4))\r\n* **components:** remove `locale` / `dir` props proxy ([#5432](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/issues/5432)) ([a6efa7a](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/a6efa7a))\r\n* **ContentNavigation/NavigationMenu/Tabs:** ensure proper badge display ([e5c11e6](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/e5c11e6))\r\n* **ContentSearchButton/DashboardSearchButton:** hide label and trailing with css when collapsed ([3e72bf8](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/commit/3e72bf8))\r\n* **FileUpload:** ensure native validation
