      "body": "## Changes\r\n\r\nWe've stopped maintaining separate validator packages (e.g., `drizzle-zod`, `drizzle-valibot`) and moved them into the `drizzle-orm` repo. This consolidates everything into a single package and eliminates the need to manage separate peer dependencies and versioning.\r\n\r\nAll packages are now available via `drizzle-orm` imports:\r\n\r\n- `drizzle-zod` -> `drizzle-orm/zod`\r\n- `drizzle-valibot` -> `drizzle-orm/valibot`\r\n- `drizzle-typebox` -> `drizzle-orm/typebox-legacy` (using `@sinclair/typebox`)\r\n- `drizzle-typebox` -> `drizzle-orm/typebox` (using `typebox`)\r\n- `drizzle-arktype` -> `drizzle-orm/arktype`\r\n\r\nYou can still use the old packages, but we recommend removing them and importing directly from `drizzle-orm`. There should be no breaking changes and a simple import change should work\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\nNew validation package is available: `drizzle-orm/effect-schema`\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as p from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';\r\nimport { createInsertSchema, createSelectSchema, createUpdateSchema } from 'drizzle-orm/effect-schema';\r\nimport { Schema } from 'effect';\r\n\r\nconst users = p.pgTable('users', {\r\n  id: p.serial().primaryKey(),\r\n  name: p.text().notNull(),\r\n  email: p.text().notNull(),\r\n  role: p.text({ enum: ['admin', 'user'] }).notNull(),\r\n  createdAt: p.timestamp('created_at').notNull().defaultNow(),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Schema for inserting a user - can be used to validate API requests\r\nconst UserInsert = createInsertSchema(users);\r\n\r\n// Schema for updating a user - can be used to validate API requests\r\nconst UserUpdate = createUpdateSchema(users);\r\n\r\n// Schema for selecting a user - can be used to validate API responses\r\nconst UserSelect = createSelectSchema(users);\r\n\r\n// Overriding the fields\r\nconst UserInsert = createInsertSchema(users, {\r\n  role: Schema.String,\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Refining the fields - useful if you want to change the fields before they become nullable/optional in the final schema\r\nconst UserInsert = createInsertSchema(users, {\r\n  id: (schema) => schema.pipe(Schema.greaterThanOrEqualTo(0)),\r\n  role: Schema.String,\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Usage\r\n\r\nconst program = Effect.gen(function*() {\r\n  const parsedUser = yield* Schema.validate(UserInsert)({\r\n    name: 'John Doe',\r\n    email: 'johndoe@test.com',\r\n    role: 'admin',\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n- Fixed sqlite select not allowing SQL.Aliased in `.orderBy(...)`, `.groupBy(...)`\r\n\r\nThis is now allowed:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst sq1 = db.$with('sq1').as((qb) =>\r\n        qb.select({\r\n          aliased: sql`count(*)`.mapWith(Number).as('alias'),\r\n        }).from(users)\r\n      );\r\n      const sq2 = db.$with('sq2').as((qb) =>\r\n        qb.select({\r\n          aliased: sql`sum(${users.id})`.mapWith(Number).as('alias'),\r\n        }).from(users)\r\n      );\r\n\r\n      const result = await db.with(sq1, sq2).select({\r\n        count: sq1.aliased,\r\n        sum: sq2.aliased,\r\n      }).from(sq1).crossJoin(sq2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Made `name` argument in `.prepare(name)` optional in `Gel`, `Postgres`, `Cockroach` dialects (generated automatically if not passed)",

You can enable logging by providing a different `EffectLogger` implementation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as PgDrizzle from 'drizzle-orm/effect-postgres';\r\nimport { EffectLogger } from 'drizzle-orm/effect-postgres';\r\nimport * as Effect from 'effect/Effect';\r\n\r\nconst program = Effect.gen(function*() {\r\n  const db = yield* PgDrizzle.make({ /* schema, relations, casing */ }).pipe(\r\n    // Enable Effect-based logging (uses Effect.log with annotations)\r\n    Effect.provide(EffectLogger.layer),\r\n    // Provide remaining default services (cache)\r\n    Effect.provide(PgDrizzle.DefaultServices),\r\n  );\r\n  const users = yield* db.select().from(usersTable);\r\n  return users;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAvailable logger options:\r\n\r\n- `EffectLogger.Default` - No-op logger (no logging occurs) - this is the default\r\n- `EffectLogger.layer` - Logs queries using Effect’s Effect.log() with annotations for query SQL and parameters. Integrates with Effect’s logging infrastructure.\r\n- `EffectLogger.fromDrizzle(logger)` - Wraps a Drizzle Logger instance for use with Effect\r\n- `EffectLogger.layerFromDrizzle(logger)` - Creates an Effect Layer from a Drizzle logger\r\n\r\n> When using EffectLogger.layer, queries are logged via Effect’s logging system. You can configure the output format by providing a different Effect logger layer (e.g., Logger.pretty for development, Logger.json for production).\r\n\r\nUsing a Drizzle logger:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as PgDrizzle from 'drizzle-orm/effect-postgres';\r\nimport { EffectLogger } from 'drizzle-orm/effect-postgres';\r\nimport * as Effect from 'effect/Effect';\r\nimport { DefaultLogger } from 'drizzle-orm';\r\n\r\nconst program = Effect.gen(function*() {\r\n  const db = yield* PgDrizzle.make({ /* schema, relations, casing */ }).pipe(\r\n    // Use a Drizzle logger wrapped for Effect\r\n    Effect.provide(EffectLogger.layerFromDrizzle(new DefaultLogger())),\r\n    // Provide remaining default services (cache)\r\n    Effect.provide(PgDrizzle.DefaultServices),\r\n  );\r\n  const users = yield* db.select().from(usersTable);\r\n  return users;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Effect Cache configuration\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can provide a custom cache implementation:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport * as PgDrizzle from 'drizzle-orm/effect-postgres';\r\nimport { EffectLogger } from 'drizzle-orm/effect-postgres';\r\nimport { EffectCache } from 'drizzle-orm/cache/core/cache-effect';\r\nimport * as Effect from 'effect/Effect';\r\nimport { MyCustomCache } from './cache';\r\n\r\nconst program = Effect.gen(function*() {\r\n  const db = yield* PgDrizzle.make({ /* schema, relations, casing */ }).pipe(\r\n    // Provide a custom cache wrapped for Effect\r\n    Effect.provide(EffectCache.layerFromDrizzle(new MyCustomCache())),\r\n    // Provide remaining default services (logger)\r\n    Effect.provide(PgDrizzle.DefaultServices),\r\n  );\r\n  const users = yield* db.select().from(usersTable);\r\n  return users;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n",
