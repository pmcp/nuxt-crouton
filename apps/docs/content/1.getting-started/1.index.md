**Nuxt Crouton** is a code generator and composable library that helps you build CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications in **[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)** 4. It provides an opinionated approach to types and CRUD patterns, with built-in authentication, team management, and admin features to help you ship production-ready applications faster.

## What It Does

Nuxt Crouton generates working CRUD interfaces including list views, forms, TypeScript types, and composables with validation. It also provides optional database migrations and smart data caching built on [useFetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch). Additional features include modal and slideover management, toast notifications, automatic cache invalidation, translation support, and team-based auth utilities.

## What It's Not

Nuxt Crouton is not a runtime admin panel like Strapi or Directus. It's not a framework but rather works within Nuxt. It doesn't replace your database—instead, it generates code that works with your existing database. And while it generates frontend components and backend stubs, it's not a complete backend solution.

## Key Principle

The philosophy behind Nuxt Crouton is simple: **Generate → Customize → Own**. Start by generating 80% of your working code in 30 seconds. Then customize the generated code however you need—it's yours to edit freely. Finally, own and maintain it as part of your codebase.

## The Rails Scaffold Approach

If you're familiar with Rails scaffolding, Nuxt Crouton works similarly. Both generate starting code that you own immediately and can customize as needed, while the core framework stays stable and receives updates independently.

```bash
# Rails
rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text

# Nuxt Crouton
npx crouton-generate blog posts --fields-file post-schema.json
```

## Architecture

Nuxt Crouton uses a two-layer architecture that separates your customizable generated code from the stable core library. You can also organize collections by domain using Nuxt layers for better maintainability and reusability.

## Built-In Features

Nuxt Crouton is a complete solution that builds on Nuxt, Nuxt UI, and NuxtHub—tools you may already be using. The core package includes:

- **Team-based authentication** with Better Auth (OAuth, passkeys, 2FA)
- **Super admin dashboard** for user and team management
- **Multi-language support** with translation management
- **NuxtHub integration** for database, KV, and blob storage
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)** ready to go

Nuxt Crouton lets you add CRUD functionality and iterate quickly. But since every project has unique requirements, it takes a scaffolding approach rather than being a framework. You generate the code you need, then customize it completely. The core components (like modal management and data operations) are opt-in, just like the internationalization and Tiptap editor support. Everything works with Nuxt layers for easy composition, giving you the best of both worlds: reusability with complete control.
