## Collections

A collection is a group of related data, similar to a database table. For example, you might have collections for `products`, `posts`, `users`, or `orders`. By convention, use plural names like `products` rather than `product`.

## Layers

A [layer](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers) represents a domain or module in your application. You might have a `shop` layer for e-commerce features, a `blog` layer for content management, an `admin` layer for user administration, or a `marketing` layer for campaigns and newsletters. Layers provide separation of concerns, can be reused across projects, and support independent deployment.

## Domain-Driven Design with Layers

You can organize your collections by domain, grouping related functionality together. For instance, your `shop` layer might contain products, orders, and inventory collections, while your `blog` layer holds posts, authors, and comments. Each layer is self-contained and can be deployed independently.

```
layers/
  ├── shop/        # E-commerce domain
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── products/
  │   │   ├── orders/
  │   │   └── inventory/
  │   └── composables/
  │
  ├── blog/        # Content domain
  │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── posts/
  │   │   ├── authors/
  │   │   └── comments/
  │   └── composables/
  │
  └── admin/       # Admin domain
      ├── components/
      │   ├── users/
      │   ├── roles/
      │   └── permissions/
      └── composables/
```

## The Two-Layer Architecture

Nuxt Crouton separates generated code from the core library. Your generated code (forms, lists, tables) lives in your project and can be customized freely. This code uses the stable core library (composables, utilities, modal management, caching) which gets updated via npm. The key insight is that your generated code can diverge from the original templates while the core library remains consistent.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Generated Code (Yours)             │
│  - Forms, Lists, Tables             │
│  - You customize freely             │
│  - Lives in YOUR project            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
            ↓ uses
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Core Library (Stable)              │
│  - Composables, utilities           │
│  - Modal management, caching        │
│  - Updates via npm                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
