/**
 * @crouton-generated
 * Collection Type Registry
 *
 * This file is auto-generated by @fyit/crouton-cli
 * Run `crouton sync-types` to regenerate after adding collections.
 *
 * Generated: 2026-02-10
 *
 * ## How This Works
 * This file augments the CollectionTypeMap interface from @crouton/types.
 * When you use useCollectionQuery('blogPosts'), TypeScript automatically
 * knows the return type is BlogPost[] without requiring explicit generics.
 *
 * ## Registered Collections
 * - triageDiscussions: TriageDiscussion
 * - triageFlowinputs: TriageFlowinput
 * - triageFlowoutputs: TriageFlowoutput
 * - triageFlows: TriageFlow
 * - triageInboxmessages: TriageInboxmessage
 * - triageJobs: TriageJob
 * - triageTasks: TriageTask
 * - triageUsermappings: TriageUsermapping
