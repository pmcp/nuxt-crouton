/**
 * Regression for #1056 — a teardown re-run must be idempotent: an already-absent
 * Worker/D1/KV is "already gone", not a failure. The bug was that runWrangler's
 * thrown Error didn't carry wrangler's stderr, and the classifier missed the real
 * Cloudflare phrasings ("Couldn't find DB", "[code: 10007]").
 *
 *   node --test scripts/lib/wrangler-d1.test.mjs
