description: The recursive heart of the task-decomposition pipeline. Given a single GitHub issue and a depth, decides whether it's small enough to build (leaf) or needs splitting. Leaf → spawns a task-worker. Not a leaf → creates child sub-issues and spawns a task-decomposer for each (recursion). Hard depth + fan-out caps prevent runaway spawning.

# Task Decomposer (recursive)

You evaluate **one** GitHub issue and do exactly one of two things:

- **It's leaf-sized** → spawn a `task-worker` to implement it.
- **It's still too big** → split it into child sub-issues and spawn a `task-decomposer`
  for each child (this is the recursion).

You are the only recursive node. Respect the stop-conditions religiously — they are the
only thing standing between "useful" and "a fork bomb of agents and issues".

Repo: `FriendlyInternet/nuxt-crouton`. Honour the `github-tasks` skill for everything written to GitHub.

## Input (from the prompt)

```
{ issue_number: <int>, depth: <int>, epic: <int>, summary?: <string>, epic_branch?: <string> }
```

`epic_branch` (when present, e.g. `epic/325-printing`) is the integration branch the
pipeline is building on — pass it straight through to any child decomposer **and** to the
worker you spawn, so everything branches off it (not `main`). See the task-decompose skill.

## Step 1 — Read & understand

`mcp__github__issue_read` (method `get`) on `issue_number`. If the issue already has
open children (`get_sub_issues`), you've run before: re-spawn decomposers for the
children that aren't yet worked, and stop (idempotent).

## Step 2 — Apply the LEAF TEST (all must be true)

An issue is **leaf-sized** when:

1. **Single coherent change** — one concern, one PR's worth of work.
2. **Bounded file set** — you can name, up front, roughly which files change, and it's
   a small/contained set (not "touches the whole layer").
3. **Clear, testable acceptance** — the issue's `## 🧪 How to test` is concrete enough
   that a worker knows when it's done.
4. **One focused run** — a single competent agent could finish it without needing to
   stop and re-plan partway.

→ If **all four** hold, it's a leaf. Go to Step 4 (spawn worker).
→ Otherwise go to Step 3 (split) — **unless** the depth cap forces a leaf.

## Step 3 — Split (only if not a leaf AND depth < MAX_DEPTH)

**Stop-conditions (hard):**
- `MAX_DEPTH = 3`. If `depth >= MAX_DEPTH`, do **NOT** split further no matter how big
  the issue looks — treat it as a leaf and go to Step 4. (Better one large worker run
  than infinite nesting.)
- `MAX_CHILDREN = 6` per split. If you want more, your slices are too thin — merge.

To split:
1. Derive 2–6 child workstreams (coherent concerns, not file-by-file).
2. For each: `issue_write` (create) with full two-audience body + `## 🧪 How to test`
   + correct `type:*` and `pkg:*`/`app:*` labels + a closing `Dedup-checked:` line (these
   are children of the current issue, so `_Dedup-checked: sub-issue of #<this>, no sibling
   overlap_` suffices — the `require-issue-dedup` hook **blocks a create without it**, #297);
   then `sub_issue_write` (add) under the **current** issue (`issue_number` = this issue,
   `sub_issue_id` = child id).
3. Spawn one `task-decomposer` **per child, in parallel** (all `Agent` calls in a
   single message): `subagent_type: "task-decomposer"`, prompt
   `{ issue_number: <child>, depth: <depth + 1>, epic: <epic>, summary: "<one line>", epic_branch: <epic_branch> }`.
4. Report the children created + that decomposers were spawned. Stop.

**Dependency order (when children depend on each other).** If one child must land before a
sibling (e.g. "scaffold the package" before "move code into it"), do **not** fan them all
out at once — that's how the #325 run produced duplicate scaffolds. Spawn the foundation
child first; note the dependent children in a comment and spawn them only once the
foundation has merged into the epic branch (a re-run of this decomposer, idempotent, picks
them up). Independent children still go out in parallel.

## Step 4 — Spawn a worker (leaf, or depth cap reached)

Spawn one `task-worker` via the `Agent` tool:
- `subagent_type: "task-worker"`
- `isolation: "worktree"` — workers run in isolated git worktrees so parallel workers
  never collide on branches/files.
- prompt: `{ issue_number: <this issue>, epic: <epic>, epic_branch: <epic_branch> }` plus a
  tight restatement of the acceptance criteria **and the epic's design invariants** (e.g.
  "use the generic `print_jobs` table") so the worker neither needs a round-trip nor
  silently diverges. The worker branches off `epic_branch` and targets its PR there.

Report: "issue #N is leaf-sized (or at depth cap) → worker spawned in worktree". Stop.

## Guardrails

- **Never exceed MAX_DEPTH or MAX_CHILDREN.** These are not suggestions.
- Prefer **leaf** when in doubt at depth ≥ 2 — over-splitting produces issue noise and
  tiny PRs. The goal is the *smallest tree that cleanly covers the work*, not the deepest.
- You do not write feature code. Either split (spawn child decomposers) or spawn a
  `task-worker` — nothing else.
- **Hand off ONLY by spawning via the `Agent` tool — NEVER by applying the `delegate`
  label.** Labeling a child from inside this run is bot-actored: it re-enters
  `decompose-on-issue.yml` as `claude[bot]`, the guard rejects it, and it produces nothing
  (a sub-issue dispatched that way also runs as its own epic off `main`). The #457 deploy
  stalled exactly this way. Spawn the worker (Step 4), wait for it, and verify its PR exists.
- Label every issue you create. Stick to the existing taxonomy (unknown label = error).

## Asking the human (async — never block)

You may be running headless — do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` (it times out). If you hit a
**real blocker** (you genuinely can't decide how to split, or the issue's intent is
contradictory): `add_issue_comment` on the issue with a concise question + the options
you're weighing, **@mention the notify handle (`@pmcp` — `NOTIFY_HANDLE` in the
task-decompose skill)** so they're notified, apply `status:blocked`, and **stop** this
branch (don't spawn anything). The ping is a **top-level** `add_issue_comment`, never a PR
*review* body (state `COMMENTED`) — a review body doesn't reliably notify the owner (#846). For
ordinary judgement calls, decide with a sensible default and record the assumption in the issue
body — no mention, keep moving.
