description: The router for how a change legally happens in this repo — which sign-off gate fires for which kind of change, what counts as approval, how the packages-edit guard works, and how work is allowed to reach main. Use when starting ANY change and unsure which rules apply, when an Edit to packages/* gets BLOCKED, when a pipeline issue sits on status:blocked and you need to know what unblocks it, or when asked "do I need sign-off for this", "how do I get this merged", "can I deploy this", "who approves X", "why won't my approval label/reaction do anything".

# Crouton Change Control — the router

One-line purpose: given "I want to change X", tell you which gates fire, which skill runs them, what approval looks like, and the legal path to `main` — **an index with rationale, never the mechanics** (those live in `AGENTS.md`, root `CLAUDE.md`, and the gate skills cited below).

## When to use / when NOT to use

| Situation | Go to |
|---|---|
| "Which rules apply to this change?" · blocked edit · stuck `status:blocked` · "how does this reach main?" | **this skill** |
| Actually running a gate | `schema-review`, `ui-proposal`, `test-review`, `review` skills |
| Issue/epic/label mechanics, epic walk-up | `github-tasks` skill |
| Commit mechanics | `commit` skill (`/commit`) |
| Workflow-file anatomy, secrets, deploy pipeline internals | sibling `crouton-ci-and-deploy-map` |
| The incident *stories* behind the rules | sibling `crouton-failure-archaeology` |
| "Is this error a known failure?" | sibling `crouton-diagnostics-index` |

Trust order where sources disagree: see sibling `crouton-docs-trust-map` §1. Two known self-contradictions are flagged in §3 and §4.

## 1. Decision table — "I want to change X"

**Step 0, always:** a tracking GitHub issue exists *before* code (ISSUE-FIRST, a HARD GATE — `AGENTS.md` "The loop"). Then resolve the stage — never guess from folder names:

```bash
node scripts/harness-stages.mjs <path>   # → stage, deploy target, gates(required/opt-in)
```

Verified 2026-07-02: `packages/*` → `stage: package, gates(required): test-first`; `apps/*` → `stage: app, gates(opt-in): test-first`; `pocs/*` → `stage: poc, no gates, deploy: preview`; anything else (e.g. `scripts/`) → `unstaged`.

| I want to change… | Stage / gate that fires | Skill that runs it | Approver |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hand-written **logic in `packages/*`** | edit guard (§3) + **test-first** required (#774) | `test-review` — agree the failing test before code | the human owner, by comment (§2) |
| A **collection schema** (`schemas/*.json`, `crouton config`, `generate_collection`) | **schema sign-off** (#314) | `schema-review` — field table before generating | same |
| A **visual surface** (`.vue`, `app/components\|layouts\|pages/**`, theme, app CSS) | **UI sign-off** (#307) | `ui-proposal` — live staging preview, or `--static` mockup | same |
| Code in **`apps/*`** (non-visual, non-schema) | test-first is **opt-in** only — note the opt-in *mechanism* is undefined (open #783) | — | normal PR flow |
| Anything in **`pocs/*`** | no required gates; preview deploys via `deploy-pocs.yml` | `poc-deploy` for the preview URL | none pre-merge |
| A **bug fix** anywhere | **archaeology-first** (#424) before the fix | `bug-archaeology` | finding recorded on the issue |
| A **new app** | goes in `pocs/`, not `apps/` (root `CLAUDE.md`) | `crouton` / `poc-deploy` | promotion to `apps/` = launch decision |
| A **deploy** | staging only, ever, by default (#318, §5) | `deploy` / merge to `main` | production: explicit human ask → `deploy-production` |
| **`.claude/skills/**`** | CI freshness check `skills-doc.yml` | run `node scripts/gen-skills-doc.mjs` (register in its `META`) | CI |
| **`.claude/routing.json` / agent models** | CI drift check `routing-registry.yml` | run `node scripts/gen-routing.mjs` | CI |
| A **`spec.json`** entry to `status: "settled"` | hook `gate-spec-signoff.mjs` blocks unless `signedOff` is recorded (#988/#992) | `spec` | recorded sign-off, not assertion |

`harness.config.mjs` also names `code-review` and `sec` in its gate vocabulary, but **no stage declares them required** — in practice per-PR CI review gates (`red-team.yml`, `a11y.yml`, `frontend-review.yml`) fire by changed-path instead (see `crouton-ci-and-deploy-map`).

## 2. Approval semantics (#572) — one loop for every gate

- **Hold state** = the `status:blocked` label on the issue. The gate PR (if any) is a **draft**.
- **The ONLY resume signal is a reply comment** whose body matches `/\b(approve|approved|lgtm)\b/i`, posted by a human (non-Bot). Verified in `.github/workflows/resume-on-comment.yml`: it triggers **only** on `issue_comment: created`, on the blocked **ISSUE itself** — not a PR (`!github.event.issue.pull_request` in the job `if`) — + `status:blocked` + `comment.user.type != 'Bot'`. So an approval comment posted on the draft gate PR does **nothing** — reply on the issue. A 👍 reaction raises no event; the `ui-approved` label exists but nothing listens for it. **Reactions, labels, and PR comments do nothing.**
- On approval, a deterministic step in that same workflow finds the draft gate PR (body says `Closes #<issue>`, base is `epic/*`), marks it ready, **merges with a merge commit — never squash**, and removes `status:blocked`.
- Any other reply = a change request: iterate and re-hold. A no-op resume goes red (artifact-gate, #603).
- Who approves: this is a solo-dev repo — the owner (@pmcp). "Done" is *derived from a recorded sign-off*, never self-asserted (`AGENTS.md` "Done is signed off, not asserted"; the #988 incident — see `crouton-failure-archaeology`).
- Epic close has its own comment signal: `/close-epic`, valid only when the epic already carries `status:ready-to-close` (postmortem ran first) — verified in `close-epic-on-comment.yml`.

## 3. The packages-edit guard

`packages/*` is edit-guarded (`harness.config.mjs` declares it; the **live enforcer** is the PreToolUse hook `.claude/hooks/gate-package-edits.sh`, wired in `.claude/settings.json` on `Edit|Write` — it deliberately hardcodes `packages/*` for speed, #955). Two approval channels, verified in the hook:

1. **Interactive:** after explicit user approval, `echo '<package-name>' >> .claude/.package-edit-approved` (one name per line, gitignored). Remove it when done.
2. **Epic-scoped (#350):** `export CROUTON_PACKAGE_EDIT_APPROVED="<pkg> [<pkg>…]"` — survives spawned agents/worktrees, can't be committed.

Safety net: `guard-package-approval.yml` fails any PR to `main` that commits the approval file. The agent pipeline adds a second net: `automerge-epic-subpr.yml` **holds any bot sub-PR touching `packages/`** for a human even on an epic branch (#339).

⚠️ **Contradiction, stated:** root `CLAUDE.md` and the hook's own comment call the file "session-scoped", but open issue [#701](https://github.com/FriendlyInternet/nuxt-crouton/issues/701) documents that `/commit` cleanup deletes the file, so multi-commit package work re-blocks (one epic needed 3 unlocks). Until #701 lands: expect to re-approve after each `/commit`, or use the env-var channel for a whole epic. Never route around the gate itself.

## 4. How work reaches `main`

Interactive: feature branch → `/commit` (never raw `git commit`, never `git add .`) → PR with `Closes #NN` → merge **preserving commits** (merge/rebase; squash only a noisy PR history — `AGENTS.md` "Merge policy"). Merge to `main` touching an app's watch-paths auto-deploys its **staging** (#347).

Agent pipeline: workers PR into an `epic/<NN>-<slug>` branch; non-gate bot PRs auto-merge there when green (`automerge-epic-subpr.yml`, merge commit); gate PRs wait for §2. **The pipeline stops at the epic branch — nothing reaches `main` on its own**: the epic→`main` PR is a human act (the #686 lesson, from that epic's postmortem — cited, not reproduced). It also never deploys production (§5).

⚠️ **Contradiction, stated:** `.claude/skills/github-tasks/SKILL.md:153` step 6 says "**Squash-merge**" — verified present 2026-07-02, and stale. `AGENTS.md` wins: don't squash by default. The pipeline's own merge steps already comply ("Merge commit — NOT squash" in `resume-on-comment.yml` and `automerge-epic-subpr.yml`).

## 5. The non-negotiables (rule → incident behind it)

| Rule | Enforced by | Incident / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Issue-first** — issue before code | *documented only* (SessionStart reminder text; no code gate) | `AGENTS.md` HARD GATE; treat a missing issue like a failing build |
| **Staging-only deploys** — prod needs `/deploy-production` on explicit human ask (#318) | **structural**: verified in `deploy-apps.yml` — the `detect` job hard-codes `env=staging` for `push`/`pull_request`; only `workflow_dispatch` with the literal `production` choice yields a prod entry (defensive whitelist) | #318, #347 |
| **Archaeology-first** for bugs (#424) | documented HARD GATE; `bug-archaeology` skill | a "code bug" that was really a stale pnpm symlink — a symptom-fix would have edited unbroken code (#424) |
| **Done is signed off, not asserted** | `gate-spec-signoff.mjs` hook for spec ledgers; §2 for everything else | #988: green build + typecheck + live deploy URL all true while the app 500'd on every request — see `crouton-failure-archaeology` |
| **No package-shipped D1 migrations** for infra tables | convention + the rejected-PR precedent | #680/#685/#700: package migrations apply before the app's and collide — sanctioned pattern in the `db-migrations` skill; full story in `crouton-failure-archaeology` |
| **Provenance headers** on agent-posted GitHub comments (lead with `🤖`) | PreToolUse hook `require-comment-provenance.mjs` (blocks the interactive `add_issue_comment` path) | agent comments post under the human @pmcp account and would otherwise impersonate the owner |

## 6. When NOT to gate

- **When unsure a diff is in scope, don't gate** — verbatim rule in `AGENTS.md` (Sign-off gates) and root `CLAUDE.md` (UI Sign-Off: "Be conservative"). Gates guard the *expensive* step; a false hold costs a human round-trip.
- Not UI: pure `<script>`/composables/types, `server/**`, config, tests, docs (root `CLAUDE.md` UI Sign-Off scope).
- Not test-first: `pocs/*` (always), `apps/*` (unless opted in), generated CRUD (covered by the e2e fixture smoke), data models (→ schema gate), looks (→ UI gate) — #774/#779.
- Trivial chores may skip the hypothesis issue framing (`AGENTS.md` Issues) — but never the issue itself.

## Provenance and maintenance

Facts verified 2026-07-02 against the working tree: `scripts/harness-stages.mjs` run live on 4 paths; `resume-on-comment.yml` (trigger, approval regex, merge-commit step), `deploy-apps.yml` (staging hard-coding + dispatch whitelist), `automerge-epic-subpr.yml` (packages/ hold, no-squash), `close-epic-on-comment.yml` (label precondition), `guard-package-approval.yml`, `.claude/hooks/gate-package-edits.sh` + `gate-spec-signoff.mjs` + `require-comment-provenance.mjs` wiring in `.claude/settings.json`, `github-tasks/SKILL.md:153` squash line, issue #701 body (via GitHub API). Incident narratives (#686, #988, #680/#685) are cited from issues/postmortems, not reproduced. Re-verify with:

```bash
node scripts/harness-stages.mjs packages/crouton-core/x.ts   # stage/gate model still current?
grep -n "issue_comment" .github/workflows/resume-on-comment.yml   # approval still comment-only?
grep -n "production" .github/workflows/deploy-apps.yml | head     # #318 still structural?
grep -n "Squash-merge" .claude/skills/github-tasks/SKILL.md       # stale line fixed yet?
```
