# Review Skill

Fast, opinionated code review for a solo dev shipping quickly. Catches real problems, skips bikeshedding.

## Modes

| Invocation | What it reviews |
|------------|----------------|
| `/review` | All uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged) |
| `/review last N` | The last N commits on current branch |
| `/review --scope <pkg>` | Uncommitted changes filtered to a package |
| `/review --file <path>` | A single file |

## Rules

1. **No style opinions** — formatting, naming preferences, comment style → skip. That's linting.
2. **No scope creep** — only review what's in the diff. Never suggest "while you're here..." changes.
3. **No praise** — don't say "nice work" or "good use of". Just flag problems or say "clean".
4. **Severity matters** — categorize every finding. Don't mix critical bugs with nits.
5. **Be specific** — file, line, what's wrong, how to fix. No vague "consider improving".
6. **Trust the dev** — if something looks intentional, don't flag it. Flag things that look accidental.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Security hole, data loss risk, crash | Must fix before shipping |
| 🟡 **Warning** | Bug likely, pattern violation, missing validation | Should fix soon |
| 🔵 **Note** | Minor issue, potential improvement | Fix when convenient |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather the diff

**For uncommitted changes** (`/review` or `/review --scope`):
```bash
git diff                  # unstaged
git diff --cached         # staged
git status               # new files
```

**For recent commits** (`/review last N`):
```bash
git log --oneline -N
git diff HEAD~N..HEAD
```

**For single file** (`/review --file <path>`):
```bash
git diff -- <path>        # if modified
# or just read the file if it's new
```

If `--scope` is set, filter to files matching `packages/<pkg>/**` or `apps/<pkg>/**`.

### Step 2: Read the full context

For every changed file, read the COMPLETE file (not just the diff). You need surrounding context to catch:
- Unused imports after a refactor
- Broken references from renames
- Duplicated logic that already exists elsewhere

For files over 500 lines, read at minimum the changed sections ±50 lines.

### Step 3: Run checks

Check every changed file against this checklist. Skip categories that don't apply (e.g., skip "API" checks for a component file).

#### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, tokens
- [ ] No `v-html` with user-controlled content (XSS)
- [ ] Server endpoints validate input (especially route params and body)
- [ ] Server endpoints check team authorization (`useTeamContext()`)
- [ ] No raw SQL — should use drizzle queries
- [ ] No `eval()`, `new Function()`, or dynamic `import()` with user input

#### Correctness
- [ ] Async operations wrapped in try/catch or use `{ data, error }` pattern
- [ ] Reactive references not destructured (loses reactivity)
- [ ] `await` not missing on async calls
- [ ] Correct HTTP method on API routes (filename matches: `.get.ts`, `.post.ts`, etc.)
- [ ] No infinite loops or unbounded recursion
- [ ] Proper cleanup in `onUnmounted` for listeners/intervals

#### Project Patterns (from CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] `<script setup lang="ts">` — never Options API
- [ ] `hub: { db: 'sqlite' }` — never `hub: { database: true }`
- [ ] `useTeamContext()` — never raw `route.params.id` for team ID
- [ ] `createError({ status, statusText })` — never `statusCode`/`statusMessage`
- [ ] Nuxt UI v4 names — `USeparator`, `USwitch`, `UDropdownMenu` (not v3 names)
- [ ] No `resolveComponent()` for optional cross-package components (use stub pattern)
- [ ] `useState()` for state — no Pinia
- [ ] Composition API only

#### Package Boundaries
- [ ] No direct DB queries for tables owned by another package (e.g., crouton-email querying `teamSettings` directly instead of going through crouton-auth exports)
- [ ] No type imports from deep internal paths of another package — use public exports or auto-imports
- [ ] API endpoints live in the package that owns the domain (e.g., team settings CRUD in crouton-core/crouton-admin, not scattered)
- [ ] No server utils in package A that duplicate logic from package B (e.g., re-implementing team resolution instead of using crouton-auth's `resolveTeamAndCheckMembership`)
- [ ] Components that belong to a domain live in that domain's package (e.g., email components in crouton-email, not crouton-core)
- [ ] Auto-imports from other packages are used via Nitro/Nuxt auto-import, not manual deep imports

#### Dead Code
- [ ] No unused imports
- [ ] No unreachable code after return/throw
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks (delete it, git has history)
- [ ] No unused variables (except intentional `_` prefix)

#### API Endpoints (server/ files only)
- [ ] Input validation with zod or similar
- [ ] Consistent error responses using `createError()`
- [ ] Team-scoped endpoints use `useTeamContext()`
- [ ] Return types are consistent (not mixing shapes)

#### Vue Components (*.vue files only)
- [ ] Props have TypeScript types
- [ ] Emits are declared with `defineEmits`
- [ ] No direct DOM manipulation (use refs or VueUse)
- [ ] Modal/Slideover uses v4 pattern (`v-model` + `#content="{ close }"`)

### Step 4: Produce the report

#### If nothing found:

```
## Review: clean ✅

Reviewed N files, no issues found.
```

#### If issues found:

```
## Review Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 🔴 Critical | X |
| 🟡 Warning | Y |
| 🔵 Note | Z |

### 🔴 Critical

#### [Short title]
**File:** `path/to/file.ts:42`
**Issue:** [What's wrong]
**Fix:** [How to fix — be specific, show code if helpful]

---

### 🟡 Warning

#### [Short title]
**File:** `path/to/file.vue:15`
**Issue:** [What's wrong]
**Fix:** [How to fix]

---

### 🔵 Note

#### [Short title]
**File:** `path/to/file.ts:88`
**Issue:** [What's wrong]
**Fix:** [How to fix]
```

### Step 5: Offer to fix

After presenting the report:

> Want me to fix any of these? (all / critical only / pick by number)

If user says "all" or "critical only", fix them directly — no confirmation per fix. Use Edit tool. After fixing, run `pnpm typecheck` on affected apps.

## Parallelization

When reviewing 5+ files, split into parallel agents:
- Group files by directory (server/, app/components/, app/composables/)
- Each agent reviews its group and returns findings
- Compile findings into single report

For <5 files, review sequentially in the main context — agent overhead isn't worth it.

## Edge Cases

### No changes
```
Nothing to review — working tree is clean and no commits specified.
```

### Binary/generated files
Skip: `*.sqlite`, `*.wasm`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.nuxt/`, `dist/`, `.wrangler/`, `node_modules/`

### Large diffs (50+ files)
Warn the user and suggest scoping:
```
50+ files changed. Consider scoping:
  /review --scope crouton-core
  /review --file path/to/important-file.ts
```
Then proceed if they confirm, using parallel agents.
